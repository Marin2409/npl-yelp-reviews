# Unlocking Language with AI: A Beginner’s Guide to NLP

Welcome to the repository for *Unlocking Language with AI: A Beginner’s Guide to NLP*! This project provides an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), a transformative field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Here, you'll find code examples, explanations, and resources to help you get started with NLP.

## Overview

This repository accompanies the article *Unlocking Language with AI: A Beginner’s Guide to NLP*. The article breaks down the essential concepts of NLP, why they matter, and how they can be applied using practical Python code. The code examples in this repo demonstrate key NLP techniques, including preprocessing, feature extraction, named entity recognition (NER), and text classification.

## What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that bridges human communication and computer understanding. It enables machines to process and analyze unstructured text data, such as emails, social media posts, or articles, making it a critical tool for extracting insights from language-rich content.

## Why NLP Matters

NLP powers a wide range of applications across industries:
- **Unlocks unstructured data**: Extracts insights from customer reviews, support tickets, and surveys.
- **Drives innovation**: Supports applications in healthcare, finance, marketing, and education.
- **Scales insights**: Automates the analysis of large text datasets.

## Core Concepts

Key NLP terms and techniques covered in this project include:
- **Corpus/Corpora**: Large text collections used to train NLP models.
- **Tokens**: Individual elements (words, numbers, punctuation) extracted from text.
- **Stop Words**: Common words (e.g., "the", "is") filtered out to focus on meaningful content.
- **Preprocessing**: Techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to clean text.
- **Feature Extraction**: Methods like Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF to convert text into numerical data.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like people, places, and organizations.
- **Word Embeddings**: Representations like Word2Vec or GloVe that capture semantic relationships.
- **Text Classification**: Algorithms like Naive Bayes for tasks such as spam detection or sentiment analysis.

## Code Examples

This repository includes Python scripts demonstrating the following NLP techniques:

1. **Preprocessing with SpaCy**:
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
   - Example: Converting "The cats were running across the fields" to `['cat', 'run', 'field']`.

2. **Feature Extraction with Scikit-learn**:
   - Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF for transforming text into numerical data.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) with SpaCy**:
   - Identifying entities in text, e.g., recognizing "Apple" as an organization in "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion".

4. **Text Classification with Naive Bayes**:
   - Building a simple spam detection model using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

To explore these examples, check the scripts in the `examples/` directory.
